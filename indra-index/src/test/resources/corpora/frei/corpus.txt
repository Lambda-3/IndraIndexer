at some point his interest goes beyond the walls of the cloister as indicated by its provision in public chair geometry of alagoas region it remained there a short time given the prospect of appointment to the same chair in recife which failed to materialize by the pernambucan revolt of <NUMBER>
frei caneca shared liberalist ideas republican thoughts and attended the academia do paraiso one of the meeting places of those who influenced by the french revolution and us independence conspired against portuguese rule
participation in revolts
movement in pernambuco and prison in bahia
caneca's first foray into political life was during the pernambucan revolt when pernambuco and other nearby states rebelled against the portuguese royal court which had relocated to brazil during the peninsular war they felt that the government was ignoring the sugar producing north in favor of the coffee producing south which was closer to rio de janeiro <NUMBER>
the revolt proclaimed a republic and organized the first independent government in the region.no reference to his participation survives in the opening events of sedition on march <NUMBER> as the formation of the provisional government thus it is that the list of voters who chose him not in his name his presence only detects the last weeks of existence of the regime to monitor the republican army which marched to the south of the province in order to face the troops of the count of arcos at which according to the indictment would have exercised captain of guerrillas he was the adviser to republican south army commanded by colonel suassuna
after the rebellion was put down he was imprisoned in salvador for four years during that time he dedicated himself to the drafting of a portuguese grammar
return to pernambuco
pardoned <NUMBER> in <NUMBER> in the context of the constitutionalist movement in portugal frei caneca returned to pernambuco and resumed political activities during his trip he came to be held in gaol of campina grande in <NUMBER> was involved in the so called movement of goiana a second sedition emancipationist movement that proclaimed adherence to the lisbon cortes with the support of the principal owners of the north woods and cotton provincial support an army of rural militias and frontline troops marched against recife without occupying the city the goianistas failed to find substantial support in the southern forest the beberibe convention consecrated in september the status quo predicting that recife and goiana would continue to operate in the areas under their control waiting for decision of the courts these determined the election of a provisional board that became the first self government of the province in october <NUMBER>
the governing board of gervasio
frei caneca supported the formation of the first board of governors of pernambuco chaired by a trader gervasio pires ferreira who appointed him to the public chair of geometry in recife it was a very recifean board where the power came from the clergy the urban strata trade the armed forces and the liberal professions the defeated forces in <NUMBER> gervasio was the dominant figure of a government that wanted consensus leader of a portuguese trade sector already nationalized by residence by birth and by family ties to the land
in <NUMBER> frei caneca who enthusiastically supported the board wrote the dissertation on what is meant by country citizen and duties to this with the same country he wanted to give theoretical formulation to one of the main objectives of gervasio to reconcile the portuguese trade in the province with the new order his main thesis was that the portuguese domiciled in the ground and connected to it by family ties and interests should be considered as pernambuco's main interest
evaldo cabral de mello stated the cortes of lisbon on one hand and the regency of dom pedro on the other embodied in terms of <NUMBER> aspirations equally legitimate options although incomplete and contradictory on one hand the sovereign congress offered a liberal regime under a constitutional monarchy though from february <NUMBER> was clear in brazil that they would charge the price of not pure and simple restoration of the commercial monopoly it was impossible to resurrect but a preferential system for trade and portuguese navigation in turn the regency of rio promised freedom of trade and independence but with the expected bill of building an authoritarian regime based in south central region of brazil
the government of gervasio tried to gain time waiting for a situation that would protect both options without entirely ruling out the separation from both lisbon and rio the board will be anathematized varnhagen jose honorio rodrigues accused of lack of national feeling their defense was made by barbosa lima sobrinho
under the pressure of a military riot the joint gervasio pires ferreira was coerced to join the cause of rio de janeiro and ended up deposed by a military uprising forming a so called yokels government in october <NUMBER>
the board of yokels
on september <NUMBER> <NUMBER> the so called board of yokels was elected which replaced the gervasiana board this government lasted until december <NUMBER> it was dominated by representatives of large landed property elected members of the board were president afonso de albuquerque maranhao secretary jose mariano de albuquerque and members francisco pais barreto squire cape francisco de paula gomes dos santos manuel inacio bezerra de melo francisco de paula cavalcanti de albuquerque and joao nepomuceno carneiro da cunha
this led frei caneca to join the fray his polemic with jose fernandes gama and his nephew judge bernardo jose da gama conspiracy leaders criticized gervasio writing pythia letters to daman pedrosada was a failed attempt to overthrow the board of yokels afterwards the gamas tried to recover in court and denounced what they called the republican faction of the province drawing up a list of suspects that included frei caneca
brother mug sided with the opposition without fighting it but he preferred to engage against the group in rio de janeiro which intended to dictate the fate of the province frei caneca even pronounced a gratitude prayer on the occasion of the thanksgiving ceremony in the church of the holy body by pedro i acclamation as emperor only from the constitution of manuel de carvalho pais de andrade government that seven months after the inauguration proclaim the confederation of ecuador there were signs of close collaboration of frei caneca with power but also in the form of journalistic activity and sporadically giving his opinion on some of the big decisions that the government should take
the first of his letters went out march <NUMBER> <NUMBER> shortly after the pedrosada it was published in the mail of rio de janeiro a periodical property of joao soares lisboa who participated in the confederation of the equator and died on september <NUMBER> <NUMBER> wounded in combat during his escape through the interior of pernambuco next to brother mug and other companions pedro da silva pedroso or pedrosa was the governor of arms of the province that retraced the pais barreto alliance that toppled gervasio without which could depose him for his support of gama in court
frei caneca never fought the board of yokels he preferred to focus on the pernambuco faction of the court endorsing the personnel policy of the emperor be it under jose bonifacio or under his successors
as for the pedrosada the established wanton that pronounced pedrosa and paula gomes and jose fernandes gama members of the government and due to the imperial protection none of them were to be punished divided and demoralized the board of yokels dragged a sad resistance until december <NUMBER> when he resigned faced by the opposition of the old gervasistas around the mayor of manuel de carvalho andrade navy parent and cipriano barata who had returned from lisbon cortes and the pressures of rio de janeiro which required pernambuco monthly amounts of the king's time and further two million equivalent to shipments to portugal after the departure of the king
the confederation of ecuador
he and others soon grew frustrated with the constitution of the newly formed empire of brazil <NUMBER> <NUMBER> which limited autonomy in the provinces and returned to secessionist politics this time becoming a leader in the confederation of the equator by providing much of its intellectual support <NUMBER> <NUMBER> in addition he published typhis pernambucano a pro confederation newspaper critical of pedro i and the imperial government from <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> <NUMBER>
it is essential to know the political and provincial context of brother mug political works the situation in which they lived pernambuco and the other provinces to understand the movement that represented the confederation of ecuador muffled under the weight of saquarema's tradition in brazilian historiography independence that is which evaldo cabral de mello called the historiography of rio de janeiro state court and its epigones in the republic claiming for the three great provinces of the southeast the role of builders of nationality.the revolutionary pernambuco cycle can not of course be considered separatists but the presumption of separatism was the result of the gap occurred between the emancipation process in the southeast and northeast in rio says cabral de mello the independence began as a dispute between absolutists and liberals around the united kingdom of portugal organization and even then not cogitated separation portugal only to preserve the status acquired by brazil within the lusitanian empire the situation was very different in the northeast where independence has started with a dispute between colony and metropolis with the difference that the latter was no longer in lisbon but in rio de janeiro
n <NUMBER> during the movement known as pedrosada brother mug i wrote the hunter and pythia letters to daman says cabral de mello page <NUMBER> of the cited work in the euphoria that followed the liberal revolution of the kingdom the expectations of reducing the burden of taxes in trade and agriculture were not lower than the rest of brazil they were perhaps larger since the installation of the court in <NUMBER> pernambuco was burdened with new taxes for including the public lighting of rio promptly revoked by gervasio's board the state of bankruptcy that had reduced banco do brasil with the return of king john vi and the establishment of provincial boards had severely limited the action of the court which had only the customs resources and province of rio de janeiro time the other provinces also denied resources thus the north accession to the emperor was above all a matter of urgent financial coffee not as profitable at the mid 30s so the main line of the tax revenue which had to come from sugar and cotton products predominantly northerners
he took part with cipriano barata as one of the leaders in the ecuadorian confederation republican and separatist movement his arguments are not directed against the emperor but against what he considered the authoritarian drift of jose bonifacio after september <NUMBER> the intensification of the fight between jose bonifacio and the liberals of the court had led to censorship of the press with the closure of newspapers and the attack on the director of the malagueta and the arrest of more than <NUMBER> individuals the same who had beaten for independence since the departure of john vi there were other dissatisfaction reasons requirements of rio de janeiro state treasury the draft constitution published by the correio brasiliense in september <NUMBER> the creation of the swiss battalion the foundation of the apostolate the institution of imperial cruise order seen as the club of servile aristocrats
evaldo cabral de mello believes it would be more appropriate instead of pernambuco republicanism consider itself autonomous the revolution project was ancient in pernambuco later comment on the judge of appeals that dismissed the motion there was a reinterpretation of provincial history in the light of revolutionary modernity represented by the political philosophy of the enlightenment and the french revolution for brother mug and the autonomous party punished by republican failure in <NUMBER> the provincial autonomy had priority over the form of government they would be ready to enter into a commitment to the rio which in exchange for acceptance of the monarchical regime would give ample relief to provinces there would be no reason to reject the monarchy since authentically constitutional and since preserved the franchises reading the newspaper cipriano barata the sentinel of liberty denied the charges of republicanism
in <NUMBER> frei caneca became one of the advisers of manuel de carvalho pais de andrade opining against recognizing francisco pais barreto the squire of the cabo as president of pernambuco he opined the alagoas invasion in order to eradicate the counter revolutionary forces squire of cabo and against the oath of the constitution bestowed by d pedro i says evaldo cabral de mello that brother mug underestimated the means at the disposal of rio court overestimating the other hand the local will of resistance to rio's despotism
d pedro i suspended constitutional guarantees in the province punishing it territorially amputating the district of san francisco on which was the left bank of the river san francisco now incorporated into the territory of bahia recife underwent naval blockade this time by admiral cochrane who bombarded the city pernambuco was invaded from the south by the troops of brigadier lima e silva the sugarcane south woods remained indifferent and september <NUMBER> <NUMBER> his troops occupied recife
again defeated he took refuge with part of the troops to the countryside going north towards ceara he was in the district today municipality of abreu e lima where shortly after he fled to ceara on that occasion he wrote the route
the typhis pernambucano
